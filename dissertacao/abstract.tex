\mychapterstar{Abstract}
In a real process, all used resources, whether physical or developed in
software, are subject to interruptions or operational commitments. However, in
situations in which operate critical systems, any kind of problem may bring big
consequences. Knowing this, this paper aims to develop a system capable to
detect the presence and indicate the types of failures that may occur in a
process. For implementing and testing the proposed methodology, a
coupled tank system was used as a study model case. The system should be
developed to generate a set of signals that notify the process operator and that
may be post-processed, enabling changes in control strategy or control
parameters. Due to the damage risks involved with sensors, actuators and
amplifiers of the real plant, the data set of the faults will be computationally
generated and the results collected from numerical simulations of the
process model. The system will be composed by structures with Artificial Neural
Networks, trained in offline mode using Matlab\reg.
